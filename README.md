# K-means
K-means from scratch in C language 

Introduction 

According to the Pareto principle 80% of the organization’s profit is achieved by 20% of customers. Therefore, it is important to target the specific consumers in order to maximize profit and establish better CRM. A simple K-means clustering algorithm is applied to divide a set of consumers into two groups on the basis of following attributes:
 Age (numeric)
 Marital: marital status (categorical: "m", "d", "s";)
 NOTE: “m” means married
 “d” means divorced or widowed
 “s” means single
 Balance: average yearly balance (numeric)
 Housing: housing loan? (binary: "y”, “n")
 NOTE: ‘y’ stands for yes
	 ‘n’ stands for no  
 Loan: has personal loan? (binary: "y”, “n")

Strategies are devised to generate more revenue on the basis of the segments obtained.

Algorithm used: K-means
